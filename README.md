# Troubleshooting 

Q: "Why doesn't (game name)'s model conversion script run?" or "(game name)'s model conversion script throws an error when ran. How do I fix it?"

A: Be sure that PyGame is installed (it's used for the mesh renderer). Also be sure that numpy is installed. 

To do this, run the following commands in either your terminal or command prompt:

pip install pygame

pip install numpy

Model conversions are stored in the same folder as the model you opened. The same thing applies to texture conversions.
